The Star Seller is a program that can theoretically be implemented in any
programming language. Here are the requirements:

-- START OF PROGRAM -- 
1-> Upon starting, the program should prompt the user with the message "What is your name? ", preferably without a line break.
2-> Immediately after, it should be accepting input.
3-> If the input is empty, the program should repeat steps 1 and 2.
4-> A message should be shown, greeting the user with the name they specified: "Hello, <name>!".
5-> The program should prompt the user with the message "How many stars do you want? ", again, preferably without a line break.
6-> It should then be accepting numerical input.
7-> If the input cannot be resolved into an integer, or the parsed value is less than zero or greater than 200, the program should repeat steps 5 and 6.
8-> An asterisk character '*' should be printed on a single line the specified number of times, according to the numerical input from step 7
9-> A message should be shown, on its own line, using the name given at step 2: "Goodbye, <name>"
-- END OF PROGRAM --
